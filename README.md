## Introduction
This project demonstrates the basics of using Firebase, focusing on its core services, including Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Realtime Database, Firebase Hosting, and Cloud Functions. It is intended to provide a starting point for integrating Firebase into a web or mobile application.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12 or later)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- A Google account to access [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/firebase-basics-project.git
   cd firebase-basics-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Firebase Setup:**

   - Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Create a new Firebase project.
   - In the project dashboard, add a new Web App (or Mobile App depending on your use case).
   - Copy the Firebase configuration object and paste it into the project’s configuration file (`/src/firebaseConfig.js`).

4. **Initialize Firebase:**

   Run the Firebase CLI in your project folder to initialize Firebase services:

   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

   Follow the prompts to select the services you want to use, such as Authentication, Firestore, Hosting, and Functions.

## Firebase Features Used

- **Firebase Authentication:** Handles user sign-in/sign-up using email/password and third-party providers like Google.
- **Cloud Firestore:** A NoSQL cloud database to store and sync data in real-time.
- **Realtime Database:** Demonstrates live syncing of data across all clients.
- **Firebase Hosting:** Deploy the app to Firebase’s global content delivery network.
- **Cloud Functions:** Backend logic can be triggered by Firebase features like Authentication or Firestore.

## How to Run the Project

### Local Development
To run the project locally:

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

2. Access the app on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Firebase Hosting Deployment

To deploy the app on Firebase Hosting:

1. Build the app for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy to Firebase:

   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

## File Structure
```bash

├── package.json             # Project dependencies and scripts
├── README.md                # Project documentation
```

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues, try the following:

- **Authentication Issues:**
  Ensure the sign-in methods are enabled in the Firebase Console under Authentication > Sign-In Method.

- **Firestore Rules:**
  If Firestore reads/writes are failing, check your security rules in the Firebase Console under Firestore > Rules.

- **Deployment Errors:**
  Ensure you have initialized Firebase Hosting with `firebase init` and have the correct project selected using `firebase use --add`.
